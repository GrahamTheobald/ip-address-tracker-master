# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### What I learned

I learned how to integrate external APIs into my project. I learned a lot regarding how to traverse documentation.

### Continued development

I attempted to install the leaflet map API through NPM but ran into trouble getting it to function. I have managed to use NPM with ease within React projects so I believe I need to pursue understanding of bundlers.
